# ya-conan-cmake-find-multi-template
Template to be used when using the cmake_find_multi conan generator for personal projects. Currently only tested (and made for) MSVC 16. Might get future edits as deemed necessary.

It includes spdlog and eastl, and uses the former to write hello world. Fancy. Targeting C++20, and uses MTd/MT on msvc.

Usage: 
1. download conan, create default profile
2. run conan/mkbuild.sh
